# Flourish

**Team Members:** Noololly (Olly) Junyali (Jun Jia)

**How we pitch our idea:** Our game flourish will have a polluting factory in the centre, surrounded by a wasteland. You will have to plant flowers, nature and creatures to restore the landscape, while fighting monsters trying to stop you from achieving this.

**Key elements to nake it fun:** The game will have a variety of puzzles to unlock new items to help rewild the world. Some resource gathering from previously rewilded sections to contiue the main quest of rewilding.

**How the game will play:** The game will start from the outside of a relatively large map, on a small section, with the starting materials to begin rewilding. The player will then reach the middle of the map, where the factory sits. They will then defeat the factory and complete the healing of the newly flourishing world.

**Sustainable gameplay:** The game will unlock new items to keep rewilding against toughening conditions as they near the centre of the map. The puzzles will provide a challenge, instead of making it too easy.
