# Paws & Plates

**Team Member:** Jeslyn Chang

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like the games "Cooking Fever" and "Papa Pizzeria" except Paws & Plates will have sushi dim sum dishes!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- Smooth interface! It will have nice vfx that feel satisfying to click and drag items of food.
- There will be neat-looking timer bars, upgrade shop (playlist, time to cook/prepare, equipment), and fun non-verbal interactions with unique customer (some will be regulars and you can build relationshipsnwith them).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will play through whichever track they choose to serve: sushi or dim sum. The game takes place on a small island full of cat customers. Each day, they will serve their chosen category of food for customers. Each customer may have a certain combination of food they want, and some may want food more urgently. Each successful day, coins will be earned, which is used to purchase more upgrades to make the shop run smoother/faster, or it can make more money with multipliers.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There will be relations built with customers. Players can advance with more coins to customize even their own user interface, such as colors for their shop, more music on the playlist, more appealing food, and happier customers who have more patience.
