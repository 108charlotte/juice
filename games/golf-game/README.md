**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "It's like [Game X] meets [Game Y] but with [Unique Element Z]" (doesn't have to follow this format)]
The beauty and intracacy of Japan compined with the simple amusement of mini-golf!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]
Mechanics: Drag and drop function to move the ball in the direction the player desires. Fun because it's simple and the player has full control over every movement. Mechanic at the end hole of the course where confetti/sounds/award is given when the player successfully completes the hole. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
Players are trying to lead their ball (sushi) through a variety of different obstables on the tee in order to sink their ball (sushi) in the hole in the shortest amount of strokes. Playing: players drag the ball in the direction they want the ball to go and let go ---> ball goes that way. 
What are they trying to achieve: Get the ball to the hole in the shortest amount of strokes. Challenges: Obstacles/walls in the way. Rewards: Gold stars, points, different skins, etc.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]
There will be a total amount of holes that the player must complete like in real-life mini-golf. The courses will start off easy which will keep them engaged in the way that they will want to stay and win because it's so simple and easy. Levels will get progressively harder as you go 
which will challenge the player.
