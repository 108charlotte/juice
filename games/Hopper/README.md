**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
What if you combined the precision and skill of DeFRaG from Quake with the high-speed, reactive platforming of Super Meat Boy?

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Reactive movement with high game dynamic. Movement is your toolkit, use it however you want!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Player will rush in many levels, some kind of danger (wave of trash, chainsaw wall, horde of monsters, etc) will make player go deeper and deeper into this unfrendly place. Player will have to use his reaction, fast-mind and quick fingers to complete levels  

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Player starts with simple movement capabilities and progressivly gets more options to use, as well as levels will require more and more skill from player as well. The main idea to make short game, but so intense that player couldn't get from it
