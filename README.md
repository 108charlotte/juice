spend 2 months building a game with your friends, go to Shanghai, China, and then run a popup cafe for people from the streets to come in and try our games. 

what's the criteria for the games? 
* languageless (no use of written or spoken word in the game or the game's interface)
* 30min+ of playable content
* 100hr+ of time spent building
* launch onto Steam store

who can come?
everyone that makes a game (travel stipends provided)

how do i get started?
add your game idea to the games folder to get started! 

when is it happening? 
it's happening April 11th - April 18th

what's the cafe going to be like?
we'll decide the specifics together in the [#juice](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C088UF12N1Z) channel, but it will be full of computers running our games where anyone can come in and play :)

new to making games?
no problem! me too.

how do i spend 100hr making the game? 
(rough outline)
1. 15 hours: making the proof of concept (no art, no sounds, just the core game mechanic and gameplay)
2. 30 hours: take a vertical slice of your game & make it great (this means take a section, typically the start & way increase the fidelity, here's where the art, sounds, story, colors, etc come into play)
3. 45 hours: build your game! you have the gameplay, you know what the style is, now build it. ship it onto itch.io and get people playing it
4. 15 hours: polish, fix bugs, and get ready to post on steam store

you should log your time working your game on https://juice.hackclub.com/ by tapping "start juicing" and then juicing until you reach an "OMG IT WORKS" moment in your process at which you film a quick demo, share it on the juice site, and can get back to juicing. Your demo will be shared on the "Kudos" app on the site and other Hack Clubbers will see your progress and can interact with it by giving them "Kudos".
