*There's never been anything like this before*

Spend 2 months building a game with your friends, go to Shanghai, China, and then run a popup cafe for people from the streets to come in and try our games.

------

## What's the criteria for the games?

- Languageless (no use of written or spoken word in the game or the game's interface)
- 30+ minutes of playable content
- 100+ hours of time spent building
- Launch onto the Steam store

------

## Who can come?

Everyone that makes a game! (Travel stipends provided.)

------

## How do I get started?

Add your game idea to the **games folder** to get started!

------

## When is it happening?

**April 4th - April 11th**

------

## What's the cafe going to be like?

We'll decide the specifics together in the [#juice](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C088UF12N1Z) channel. It will be full of computers running our games where anyone can come in and play!

------

## New to making games?

No problem! Me too.

------

## How do I spend 100 hours making the game?

*(Rough outline)*

1. **15 hours**: Make the proof of concept (no art, no sounds, just the core game mechanic and gameplay).
2. **30 hours**: Take a vertical slice of your game & make it great (this means take a sectionâ€”typically the startâ€”and increase the fidelity. Here's where the art, sounds, story, colors, etc., come into play).
3. **45 hours**: Build your game! You have the gameplay, you know the styleâ€”now build it. Ship it onto itch.io and get people playing it.
4. **15 hours**: Polish, fix bugs, and get ready to post on the Steam store.

You should log your time working on your game on [juice.hackclub.com](https://juice.hackclub.com/) by tapping "Start Juicing." Juice until you reach an **"OMG IT WORKS"** moment in your process. At that point, film a quick demo, share it on the Juice site, and then get back to juicing!

Your demo videos you upload throughout the day will be shared on the **Kudos app** on the site. Other Hack Clubbers will see your progress and can interact with it by giving "Kudos."

------

## Where will I stay while I'm there?

We'll provide housing! More details to come :)
